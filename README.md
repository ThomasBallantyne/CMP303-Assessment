Godot was used to make this project so the file is too big to be sent the repository with the full files will be linked below.

The Godot Scripts are linked to scenes and objects, which will include interaction with ui and game logic. These scripts will link to the GDNative CPP files, which has functions that will be called from the Godot Scripts.
